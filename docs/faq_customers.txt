üß© PRODUCT OVERVIEW
Q: What does RevPilot AI actually do?
A: RevPilot AI is an AI-powered sales automation platform. It helps B2B sales teams:

Find and enrich high-quality leads,

Write persona-personalized cold outreach,

Orchestrate multi-channel sequences (email, LinkedIn, phone),

Analyze what works across the team.

Q: What makes us different from other tools like Outreach, Apollo, or Lavender?
A:

Apollo = Database.

Outreach = Sequencing.

Lavender = Copy assistant.

RevPilot = All-in-one outbound co-pilot with live enrichment, AI personalization, and team analytics.

We sit across data, content, and execution ‚Äî and we optimize every step.

Q: Do reps still have to write emails manually?
A: Nope. RevPilot generates cold emails, DMs, and call scripts automatically. Reps can approve, edit, or regenerate with one click. The system learns over time.

Q: Can RevPilot integrate with our CRM?
A: Yes. Native integrations with:

Salesforce (bi-directional),

HubSpot,

We also support Zapier + API access for custom flows.

Q: What pain do we solve?
A:

Reps waste time researching leads and writing outreach.

Quality is inconsistent across reps.

Leaders don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs working or why.

üß† TECHNICAL & OBJECTIONS
Q: Is the AI actually good at personalization?
A: Yes ‚Äî we combine company signals (funding, hiring, tech stack) + persona triggers (job change, content engagement). Emails are not just ‚Äú{{FirstName}} ‚Äì saw you're hiring‚Äù templates. They are contextual and human-sounding.

Q: What if we already use Apollo or Outreach?
A:

Apollo = database. You can keep it ‚Äî we enhance it with better enrichment + writing.

Outreach = sequencing. RevPilot‚Äôs AI layer sits on top, or you can migrate over time.

We often augment, then replace legacy tools.

Q: Is my team‚Äôs data secure?
A:

SOC2 certified.

End-to-end encryption.

No data shared between customers.

Option to run models in a private cloud (for enterprise).

Q: What if the AI says something wrong or weird?

Human-in-the-loop: reps always have final say.

Guardrails built in: we don‚Äôt allow hallucinations or risky content (e.g. false claims, sensitive data).

Feedback loop improves quality over time.

Q: Can RevPilot help with warm leads or inbound too?
A: Yes ‚Äî you can:

Create follow-up sequences for inbound demo requests.

Personalize outreach to free trial signups or content downloads.
