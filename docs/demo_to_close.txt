Document Owner: Sales Enablement
Last Updated: June 7, 2025
Applies To: All AEs and SDRs managing live demos and pipeline deals

Drive consistency and conversion by standardizing the flow from demo → deal close. This playbook ensures that every qualified prospect:

Leaves the demo with clear ROI

Moves forward with urgency

Has no confusion around implementation, pricing, or outcomes

🛠️ Required Tools
HubSpot (CRM + pipeline tracking)

Notion (Demo tracker + call notes)

Slack (#sales-support for deal help)

Loom (custom follow-ups)

RevPilot test workspace (for live personalization demos)

🔁 Process Overview
Stage	Owner	Timeline
Demo Prep	AE	24h before demo
Live Demo Delivery	AE	Scheduled time
Post-Demo Follow-Up	AE	Within 24h
Objection Handling	AE	Ongoing
Pilot / POC Setup	AE + CS	Optional (deal-dependent)
Contract & Close	AE	< 14 days post-demo

1️⃣ Demo Prep Checklist
Before the call:

✅ Research the company (firmographics, funding, hiring, tech stack)

✅ Look up the attendee (persona, recent posts, LinkedIn signals)

✅ Pre-load 3–5 leads into RevPilot to showcase live AI writing

✅ Personalize demo deck (ICP use case, relevant case study)

2️⃣ Live Demo Flow (30–40 min)
Segment	Time	Notes
Intro & Agenda	3–5 min	Establish goals of the call
Discovery Questions	5–7 min	Current tools, team size, challenges
Product Walkthrough	15–20 min	Focus on real use case, not feature tour
ROI Proof Points	5 min	Use data: reply rates, time saved
Pricing & Next Steps	5 min	Anchor toward pilot or contract discussion

Pro Tip: Always show AI in action during the demo. Create or regenerate a cold email live — it builds trust.

3️⃣ Post-Demo Follow-Up
Send within 24 hours:

Personalized Loom recap (ideal) or email summary

Include:

Key problems discussed

What we showed + outcomes

Pilot or contract options

Attached case study and pricing PDF

4️⃣ Common Objections & Rebuttals
Objection	Suggested Rebuttal
“We already use Apollo/Outreach”	We plug in or augment those tools — not replace on Day 1. Start by testing AI performance on a rep or pod.
“Is the AI reliable?”	It’s trained on thousands of reps and continuously fine-tuned. You always have human control before sending.
“We’re too small right now”	We help lean teams scale without adding headcount. Book 2–3x more meetings with the same team.
“We don’t do outbound yet”	Many customers start outbound for the first time with RevPilot because it’s guided, efficient, and pre-built.

5️⃣ Optional: POC / Pilot Structure
Component	Details
Length	14–21 days
Scope	1 ICP, 1–2 reps, 50–100 contacts
Success Criteria	Reply rate >15%, 2+ meetings booked, CRM integrated
Resources Provided	Leads, templates, AI walkthrough, rep training

6️⃣ Closing Flow
Ideal Close Flow:

Confirm buyer is aligned on pricing, outcomes, and team rollout

Share contract via HubSpot + DocuSign

Loop in CS with Notion handoff doc

Trigger onboarding via Slack → #cs-handovers

Mark “Closed Won” in HubSpot

Red Flags to Watch:

"Send me info" without scheduling a follow-up

Long delays between meetings

No exec sponsor or unclear budget

📈 Deal Hygiene & Best Practices
Update HubSpot after every meeting

Always log objections + deal blockers in the notes

Use Notion deal tracker to flag “at-risk” demos
